E-commerce platforms rely heavily on customer reviews to build trust and influence purchasing decisions. Sentiment analysis, a branch of Natural Language Processing (NLP), plays a crucial role in extracting meaningful insights from these reviews. This study focuses on leveraging NLP techniques to analyze customer sentiments—classifying them as positive, negative, or neutral—to help businesses understand customer perceptions and improve their products and services. 
Key methodologies include text preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning models such as Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and deep learning approaches like transformers. 
In the rapidly evolving world of e-commerce, customer reviews play a pivotal role in shaping purchasing decisions and brand reputation. With millions of customers sharing their opinions online, businesses are presented with an invaluable source of consumer insights. However, manually analyzing this massive volume of feedback is both time-consuming and impractical. This is where Natural Language Processing (NLP) comes into play.
Sentiment analysis, a subfield of NLP, focuses on identifying and extracting subjective information from text data. It enables machines to understand and interpret human emotions expressed in written language. By applying sentiment analysis to customer reviews, e-commerce platforms can automatically classify opinions as positive, negative, or neutral, providing actionable insights to enhance customer experience, improve products, and inform marketing strategies.
